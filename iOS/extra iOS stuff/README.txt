README for extra iOS stuff

Car Steering is the iOS app we used to control the car through native iOS. So if you don't want to worry about the Heroku server and pulling interfaces from the cloud, start here.

TemperatureSensor was our exploration into Apple's coreBluetooth Framework. They have this app published online, clearly paired up with some device somewhere. We didn't get very far, but were able to see all the characteristics and services associated with the BLE device. http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/TemperatureSensor/Introduction/Intro.html
